### Mapping Proposal for Target Field: `CUSTOMER_ID`
#### **Target Field Description**
- **Physical Column Name**: `CUSTOMER_ID`
- **Logical Column Name**: `Customer ID`
- **Column Description**: Unique identifier for the customer
- **Data Type**: `VARCHAR`
- **Length**: 20

#### **Source Examination**
Based on the detailed research and metadata exploration, I have identified relevant tables with potential mappings for the `CUSTOMER_ID` field:

1. **Table:** `TEST_GENESIS.DATA.CUSTOMERS`  
   - **Field:** `CUSTOMER_ID` (NUMBER)
   - **Characteristics:** Holds unique identifiers for customers, likely a primary key.
   - **Matching Details:** Provides customer information such as customer ID, first name, last name, etc.
   - **SQL Transformation for VARCHAR Conversion:** `CAST(CUSTOMER_ID AS VARCHAR)`
   - **Validation:** Numbers are consistent with the target format as `VARCHAR(20)` after transformation.

2. **Table:** `INSURANCE_DEMO.PUBLIC.CUSTOMER_INFO`  
   - **Field:** `CUSTOMER_ID` (NUMBER with IDENTITY DEFAULT)
   - **Characteristics:** Ensures uniqueness as it is an auto-incrementing field.
   - **Matching Details:** Primarily stores customer information such as name, age, gender.
   - **SQL Transformation for VARCHAR Conversion:** `CAST(CUSTOMER_ID AS VARCHAR)`
   - **Validation:** This source is less focused compared to `TEST_GENESIS.DATA.CUSTOMERS` but can serve as a secondary option.

3. **Table:** `DEMO_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.DEMO_CUSTOMER_TGT`  
   - **Field:** `CUSTOMER_ID` (VARCHAR)
   - **Characteristics:** A direct match to the target data type and length requirement.
   - **Matching Details:** Customer information focused on purchases and behaviors.
   - **Transformation Required:** None, as the type is already a string.
   - **Validation:** Focused on analytics where customer activity is recorded, not general customer information.

### **Primary Proposed Mapping**
#### Source Table:
- **`TEST_GENESIS.DATA.CUSTOMERS`**

#### Source Column:
- **`CUSTOMER_ID`**

#### Mapping Logic:
- Select the `CUSTOMER_ID` field from `TEST_GENESIS.DATA.CUSTOMERS` and convert the datatype from `NUMBER` to `VARCHAR(20)`.

#### SQL Mapping:
```sql
SELECT 
    CAST(CUSTOMER_ID AS VARCHAR(20)) AS CUSTOMER_ID
FROM TEST_GENESIS.DATA.CUSTOMERS;
```

#### Justification:
- The primary source (`CUSTOMER_ID` in `TEST_GENESIS.DATA.CUSTOMERS`) is highly reliable, containing well-defined and specific customer information.
- Conversion to the target data type is straightforward with this table, and it complies with the target format requirement.

### **Secondary Option**
#### Source Table:
- **`INSURANCE_DEMO.PUBLIC.CUSTOMER_INFO`**

#### Source Column:
- **`CUSTOMER_ID`**

#### Mapping Logic:
- Convert `CUSTOMER_ID` from `NUMBER` to `VARCHAR` using the `CAST()` function.

#### SQL Mapping:
```sql
SELECT 
    CAST(CUSTOMER_ID AS VARCHAR(20)) AS CUSTOMER_ID
FROM INSURANCE_DEMO.PUBLIC.CUSTOMER_INFO;
```

#### Justification:
- Although this table also contains general customer information, it focuses on broader demographic data like age, gender, and state, making it slightly less focused for this project.
- It can still provide a valid and unique identifier for customers.

### **Validation**
- Both options were validated against their respective tables to ensure sources contain the necessary `CUSTOMER_ID` field.
- Transformation logic respects the target field's data type and length requirements (`VARCHAR(20)`).
- Null handling is unnecessary as the `CUSTOMER_ID` fields are not nullable in the examined sources.
