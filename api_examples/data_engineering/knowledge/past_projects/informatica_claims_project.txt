Below is the lineage for each field produced by a previous project:
For each field, we list:
target field: <field name>
sources: fully qualified source tables in database.schema.table notation and columns from each table if multiple columns are used
transformation: show the exact transformations applied to source columns to generate the target field

target field: PATIENT_ID
source table including connection_id: (my_databricks)BRONZE.healthcare_claims.CLAIMS_BRONZE
source field: PATIENT_ID
tranformation: Directly mapped from (my_databricks)BRONZE.healthcare_claims.CLAIMS_BRONZE.PATIENT_ID

Historical Notes from 2019 Claims Migration Project:
-----------------------------------------------
Raw notes from previous implementation:

member_nbr -> came from claims.raw_claims.mbr_id
claim_number -> claims.source_claims.clm_id + claims.source_claims.clm_seq_no concatenated
service_dt -> claims.raw_claims.date_of_svc, needed cleanup for Y2K dates
diagnosis -> claims.raw_claims.diag1, had to handle both ICD-9 and ICD-10
npi -> provider.master.npi_id joined to claims.raw_claims.prov_id
cpt -> claims.raw_claims.proc_cd, some legacy CPT-4 codes needed updates
charged -> claims.raw_claims.chrg_amt, divided by 100 (was stored as pennies)
allowed -> claims.raw_claims.alw_amt / 100
paid -> claims.raw_claims.pd_amt / 100
pos -> claims.raw_claims.svc_loc mapped through reference table
claim_category -> derived from first digit of claim type
admit_date -> facility_claims.admit_dt
discharge_date -> facility_claims.disch_dt
drg_code -> facility_claims.drg where claim_type = 'I'
revenue_code -> facility_claims.rev_cd
specialty -> provider.master.spec_cd mapped through CMS specialty table
network_ind -> derived from claims.raw_claims.par_stat
modifiers -> concatenated mod1, mod2, mod3, mod4 from claims.raw_claims
auth_number -> claims.raw_claims.auth_id when required = 'Y'
copay -> claims.raw_claims.copay_amt / 100
deductible -> claims.raw_claims.ded_amt / 100

Note: Field names have changed significantly since this implementation. Many source systems have been upgraded. Use as reference only.

WARNING: Some transformations were specific to legacy systems and may not apply to current state.

TODO: Need to verify current source system field names and data types before using these mappings.
