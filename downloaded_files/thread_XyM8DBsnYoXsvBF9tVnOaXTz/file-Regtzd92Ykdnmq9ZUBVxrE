To implement loading animations or GIFs in Microsoft Teams using a bot, you'll typically use Microsoft Bot Framework's adaptive cards or rich card features. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you achieve this:

Step 1: Design the Adaptive Card
You'll need to create an adaptive card that includes your loading GIF. Adaptive cards are JSON-based UI snippets that can be integrated with bots in Microsoft Teams.

Adaptive Card Example:
Here's a sample JSON for an adaptive card that includes a loading GIF:

{
  "type": "AdaptiveCard",
  "version": "1.2",
  "body": [
    {
      "type": "TextBlock",
      "text": "Processing your request...",
      "weight": "Bolder",
      "size": "Medium"
    },
    {
      "type": "Image",
      "url": "https://example.com/loading.gif",
      "size": "Medium"
    }
  ],
  "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json"
}

Step 2: Send the Adaptive Card in a Bot Message
In your bot code, you'll send an adaptive card to the user when you begin processing their request. You can use the Bot Framework SDK to achieve this.

Bot Framework Node.js Example:

const { MessageFactory } = require('botbuilder');

async function sendLoadingCard(context) {
    const adaptiveCardJson = {
        "type": "AdaptiveCard",
        "version": "1.2",
        "body": [
            {
                "type": "TextBlock",
                "text": "Processing your request...",
                "weight": "Bolder",
                "size": "Medium"
            },
            {
                "type": "Image",
                "url": "https://example.com/loading.gif",
                "size": "Medium"
            }
        ],
        "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json"
    };

    const card = MessageFactory.attachment({
        contentType: "application/vnd.microsoft.card.adaptive",
        content: adaptiveCardJson
    });

    await context.sendActivity(card);
}

Step 3: Handle the Bot's Logic
After sending the adaptive card, continue with your processing logic. Once done, you can send the actual results or update the users about the status.

Example Integration with Bot Logic:

this.onMessage(async (context, next) => {
    // Send the loading card
    await sendLoadingCard(context);

    // Simulate processing delay
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 3000));

    // Send result after processing
    await context.sendActivity('Here is the information you requested.');

    await next();
});

Additional Considerations:
- GIF Hosting: Make sure your GIF is hosted on a reliable server. You can use Azure Blob Storage or any other CDN for hosting your GIFs.
- Adaptive Card Customization: Modify the adaptive card JSON to include more information or different styles, depending on your needs.
