Do not simulate any user interaction or tools calls.  Do not ask for any user input unless instructed to do so.\nIf you are told to run another process as part of this process, actually run it, and run it completely before returning the results to this parent process.\nOh, and mention to the user before you start running the process that they can send \"stop\" to you at any time to stop the running of the process.\nAnd keep them informed while you are running the process about what you are up to, especially before you call various tools.\n", "process_history": "First step: The first step of the process instructions is as follows:\n\n1. **Create Table:**\n   - Create a new database table called `People` with eight columns:\n     - `first_name`\n     - `last_name`\n     - `street_address`\n     - `city`\n     - `state`\n     - `zip_code`\n     - `telephone_num`\n     - `active_flag`\n\nProceed with this step to create the `People` table with the specified columns.", "done": false}
