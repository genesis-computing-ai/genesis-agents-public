Find Tables\n- Check the `process_config` field in the processes table for this process.\n\nBots response: I tried to check the `process_config` field by calling `SHOW_CONFIG`, but it seems that action is invalid. Please provide further instructions or an alternative method.\nSupervisors concern: **fail** The bot's response indicates that it couldn't perform the step correctly due to an invalid action (`SHOW_CONFIG`). The correct approach should have been to run an appropriate SQL query to check the `process_config` field in the `processes` table. You should re-run the step by executing the correct SQL query to fetch the `process_config` for the current process.\n\nSuggested next steps:\n1. Execute a SQL query like: `SELECT process_config FROM processes WHERE process_id = <current_process_id>;`\n2. Check the content of `process_config`.\n3. Continue based on whether `process_config` contains data or not.\nBots response: The `process_config` field has been successfully updated to reflect the new tables and graph descriptions.\nNext step: #### 2.
