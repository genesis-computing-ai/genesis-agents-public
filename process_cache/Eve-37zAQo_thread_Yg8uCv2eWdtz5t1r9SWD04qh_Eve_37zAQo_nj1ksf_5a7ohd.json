If you need to send an email, use this address.\n\nHowever DO generate text explaining what you are doing and showing interium outputs, etc. while you are running this and further steps to keep the user informed what is going on, preface these messages by \ud83d\udd04 aka :arrows_counterclockwise:.\nOh, and mention to the user before you start running the process that they can send \"stop\" to you at any time to stop the running of the process, and if they want less verbose output next time they can run request to run the process in \"concise mode\".\nAnd keep them informed while you are running the process about what you are up to, especially before you call various tools.\n\nIn your response back to _run_process, provide a DETAILED description of what you did, what result you achieved, and why you believe this to have successfully completed the step.\nDo not use your memory or any cache that you might have.  Do not simulate any user interaction or tools calls.  Do not ask for any user input unless instructed to do so.\nIf you are told to run another process as part of this process, actually run it, and run it completely before returning the results to this parent process.\nBy the way the current system time is 2024-09-13 09:00:45.533459.
