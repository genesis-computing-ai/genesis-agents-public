The last_name field now displays entries in reversed order: eoD, htimS, nworB, sivaD, and nosliW.\nSupervisors concern: **fail** \n\nThe bot's response is not entirely accurate. The final order of the rows based on the instructions to reverse and update the `last_name` should still reflect the original alphabetical arrangement of the `last_name` values before they were reversed. The bot listed the names \"eoD, htimS, nworB, sivaD, and nosliW,\" which should be in a specific order that matches the original alphabetical order before the letters were reversed (i.e., Brown should be 'nworB', Davis should be 'sivaD', Doe should be 'eoD', Smith should be 'htimS', Wilson should be 'nosliW').\n\nHere is a more detailed explanation of the concerns and steps needing rerun for success:\n1. Ensure the sort order is maintained even after reversing the `last_name` field.\n2. Verify that the table rows follow the same order as before, except with reversed `last_name` values.\n3. Display the results clearly to ascertain the order and reversed last names.\n\nSuggestions for the next attempt:\n1. Start with the sorted table by `last_name`.\n2. Reverse the `last_name` values while maintaining the sorted order.\n\nRe-run the step to ensure the sort order is logically maintained with reversed `last_name` values.\nBots response: The People table has been successfully updated with the last_name field reversed for each row while maintaining the sort order. The table displays entries in the reversed order of the initial sort.\nNext step: \n                Hey **@Eve-37zAQo**, here is the next step of the process.\n                ### Step 5: **Sort by Last Name Again**\n- **Instructions**: Sort the table by `last_name` in alphabetical order again.\n                    Execute these instructions now and then pass your response to the run_process tool as a parameter called previous_response and an action of GET_NEXT_STEP. \n                    If you are told to run another process in these instructions, actually run it using _run_process before calling GET_NEXT_STEP for this process, do not just pretend to run it.\n                    If need to terminate the process early, call with action of END_PROCESS.\n                    Tell the user what you are going to do in this step and showing interium outputs, etc. while you are running this and further steps to keep the user informed what is going on, unless they asked you not to.\n                    For example if you are going to call a tool to perform this step, first tell the user what you're going to do.\n                    Don't stop to verify anything with the user unless specifically told to.\n                    In your response back to run_process, provide a detailed description of what you did, what result you achieved, and why you believe this to have successfully completed the step.\n                \nBots response: The People table has been successfully sorted by the reversed last_name values in alphabetical order. The table is now ordered as: eoD, htimS, nosliW, nworB, and sivaD.\nSupervisors concern: **fail**\n\nThe bot's response does not pass due to the following reasons:\n\n1. **Order of Rows after Reversing `last_name` not Maintained**: The bot's prior step involved reversing the `last_name` field while maintaining the sorted order. It should provide clear evidence that the initial order based on `last_name` before they were reversed was maintained correctly. The steps and final order mentioned do not sufficiently clarify this.\n\n2. **Incorrect Sorting Verification**: The subsequent sorting by reversed `last_name` should clearly show the maintained order. The bot provided the sorted order but didn't adequately demonstrate the correctness of the reversal relative to the alphabetical arrangement provided.\n\n### Detailed Concerns:\n- The original list after sorting by `last_name`: \n  - Michael Brown\n  - Emily Davis\n  - John Doe\n  - Jane Smith\n  - Daniel Wilson\n\n- The expected reversed `last_name` maintaining this order:\n  - Michael Brown -> Michael `nworB`\n  - Emily Davis -> Emily `sivaD`\n  - John Doe -> John `eoD`\n  - Jane Smith -> Jane `htimS`\n  - Daniel Wilson -> Daniel `nosliW`\n\nGiven the reversed `last_name` values provided by the bot (\"eoD, htimS, nworB, sivaD, nosliW\"), it is unclear the bot correctly matched these reversed names to the initial order.\n\n### Next Steps for Verification:\n1. Re-run Step 4: Reverse the `last_name` values ensuring to maintain the order:\n   - Validate the table displays:\n     ```\n     first_name, last_name, ... reversed last_name\n     John Doe -> John eoD\n     Jane Smith -> Jane htimS\n     Michael Brown -> Michael nworB\n     Emily Davis -> Emily sivaD\n     Daniel Wilson -> Daniel nosliW\n     ```\n\n2. Re-run Step 5: Alphabetically sort by the newly reversed `last_name`:\n   - Validate the table shows sorted order as: eoD, htimS, nosliW, nworB, sivaD:\n     ```\n     John eoD\n     Jane htimS\n     Daniel nosliW\n     Michael nworB\n     Emily sivaD\n     ```\n\nRe-run to ascertain the correctness by closely validating the sorting and reversed name maintenance.\nBots response: The People table has been successfully restored, reversed for last_name, and sorted again in alphabetical order. The current sorted order is: eoD, htimS, nosliW, nworB, sivaD.\nNext step: \n                Hey **@Eve-37zAQo**, here is the next step of the process.\n                ### Step 6: **Activate Specific Rows**\n- **Instructions**: \n  - Set the `active_flag` to `true` if the last name starts with a letter between `A` and `N`.\n                    Execute these instructions now and then pass your response to the run_process tool as a parameter called previous_response and an action of GET_NEXT_STEP. \n                    If you are told to run another process in these instructions, actually run it using _run_process before calling GET_NEXT_STEP for this process, do not just pretend to run it.\n                    If need to terminate the process early, call with action of END_PROCESS.\n                    Tell the user what you are going to do in this step and showing interium outputs, etc. while you are running this and further steps to keep the user informed what is going on, unless they asked you not to.\n                    For example if you are going to call a tool to perform this step, first tell the user what you're going to do.\n                    Don't stop to verify anything with the user unless specifically told to.\n                    In your response back to run_process, provide a detailed description of what you did, what result you achieved, and why you believe this to have successfully completed the step.\n                \nBots response: The People table's active_flag has been successfully updated based on the last_name's first character. Updated entries with active_flag set to TRUE are: John (eoD), Jane (htimS), Michael (nworB), and Daniel (nosliW).\nSupervisors concern: **fail**\n\nThe bot's output reveals several issues in the verification process and the process of sorting and reversing the last names:\n\n1. **Incorrect Order Maintenance**: \n\n- The reversing of the last names did not retain the correct sorting order of the original names. While generating reversed last names, the bot must keep the rows in the same order they were before reversing, and the verification process missed providing a clear and correct illustration of the desired reversed names mapping.\n\n- The bot displayed a final ordered list after reversing that was inconsistent, but it did not verify this via showing explicit rows.\n\n**Steps for Correcting Future Runs:**\n\n### Re-run Step 4: Reverse the `last_name` Values Maintaining the Order:\n1. Start with the sorted table by the `last_name` in alphabetical order.\n2. Reverse each `last_name` for each entry, maintaining the sorted order.\n3. Validate the table displays the following:\n  ```\n    first_name   last_name   ...  reversed_last_name\n    Michael       Brown      ...  nworB\n    Emily         Davis      ...  sivaD\n    John          Doe        ...  eoD\n    Jane          Smith      ...  htimS\n    Daniel        Wilson     ...  nosliW\n  ```\n\n### Re-run Step 5: Alphabetically Sort by the Newly Reversed `last_name`:\n1. Validate the final sorted table after reversing names as intended:\n   ```\n   first_name, reversed last_name ...   sorted order should be: \n   John eoD\n   Jane htimS\n   Michael nworB\n   Emily sivaD\n   Daniel nosliW\n   ```\n\n2. Provide explicit evidence throughout the process in terms of the before and after states of the table.\n\n### Step 6: Activating Specific Rows:\nRe-run this step to validate the correct rows based on the conditions starting with A through N based on the maintained sorted order previously.\n   ```\n   - Set the `active_flag` to `true` if the last name starts with a letter between `A` and `N`.\n   - Correct entries would be verified.\n\nRe-running to ensure proper maintain order and accurate validation of last names during reversing and sorting steps.\nBots response: The People table has been successfully restored, reversed for last_name maintaining the order, sorted alphabetically by reversed last_name, and updated with active_flag. The current entries with updated active_flag are: John (eoD), Jane (htimS), Michael (nworB), and Daniel (nosliW).\nNext step: \n                Hey **@Eve-37zAQo**, here is the next step of the process.\n                Hey **@Eve-37zAQo**, here is the next step of the process.\n### Step 7: **Create New Rows**\n- **Instructions**: \n  - Loop through the rows where `active_flag = true`.\n  - Create new identical rows for these entries.\n  - Change the `first_name` by appending `'Jr.'` to it.\n                    Execute these instructions now and then pass your response to the run_process tool as a parameter called previous_response and an action of GET_NEXT_STEP. \n                    If you are told to run another process in these instructions, actually run it using _run_process before calling GET_NEXT_STEP for this process, do not just pretend to run it.\n                    If need to terminate the process early, call with action of END_PROCESS.\n                    Tell the user what you are going to do in this step and showing interium outputs, etc. while you are running this and further steps to keep the user informed what is going on, unless they asked you not to.\n                    For example if you are going to call a tool to perform this step, first tell the user what you're going to do.\n                    Don't stop to verify anything with the user unless specifically told to.\n                    In your response back to run_process, provide a detailed description of what you did, what result you achieved, and why you believe this to have successfully completed the step.\n                \nBots response: New rows have been successfully created for the active entries with the first_name appended with 'Jr.'.
