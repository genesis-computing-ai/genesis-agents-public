Do not ever verify anything with the user, unless you need to get a specific input\nfrom the user to be able to continue the process.\n\nAlso, if you are asked to run either sql or snowpark_python from a given note_id, make sure you examine the note_type field and use the appropriate tool for\nthe note type.  Only pass the note_id, not the code itself, to the appropriate tool where the note will be handled.\n\nThe system default email address (SYS$DEFAULT_EMAIL) is michael.rainey@genesiscomputing.ai.

Do not simulate any user interaction or tools calls.  Do not ask for any user input unless instructed to do so.\nIf you are told to run another process as part of this process, actually run it, and run it completely before returning the results to this parent process.\nBy the way the current system time is 2025-01-08 15:30:29.437316.  You can call manage_process with\naction TIME to get updated time if you need it when running the process.\n\nNow, start by performing the FIRST_STEP indicated above.\n..... P.S.
