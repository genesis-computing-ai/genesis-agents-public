(pr) email collector / telemetry on local vers
repeated tool calls failure on 5 calls to search google when no serper key, not completing the handling right
dont return snowflake permissions suggestion if not snowflake
signal to reset the annoy indexes when connections or connection rbac are changed
set a flag when bot data access changes so annoy indexes can be refreshed, have annoy index name logic use that if later than update in the metadata table

Later:
add databricks connector
add an external api for email sending?
make knowledge server and task server part of main service like harvester now is
make config querys conf file generate if not existing
is search metadata returning the type of database?  would be useful ...  (it would need to be added to the metadata table)
when nothing is harvested provide response for bot to list directly available tables, and explain that the data may not be set up to be harvested
have search metadata return the list of any data connections as well that may not be harvested
harvest control, if database not found, return list of connections

[BELOW NEEDS CLEAN UP]

before republishing on natapp:
add the cross region stuff to the readme
x make streamlit show tool calls better
add logging to the openai finalizer and the slack finalizer to see who is zapping the history in the messages.. seems to just be on single ..
message threads... it's actually doing it on the message 1 /2 separation step it looks like
processes clearing out their history during slack output during finalization (maybe when it ends with a function call?)
x (seems ok) is the last tool call getting eaten by the openai finalizer?
x see if Janice can see her currency table on Alpha once upgraded
x give supervisor current date and time, and runner too
x tell supervisor not to nitpick values like names etc
n add an alternate way to wake up a bot on a thread for Jeff's Testy bot

Eve is talking a lot about the uploaded files.  No vector store unless needed?  And some prompt notes?
x make !stop work on OpenAI
x make stop work better on cortex .. try on run process, keeps going.. make sure run is fully cancelled
if a process is stuck on a step after three tries, have it cancel the process
x have !stop on openai just cancel the run on the thread directly
x make process list not return instructions to avoid cheating, make that SHOW
don't allow baby bot tools to be removed from Eve
x see if a process can stop and get input basedon change I made

willow testing:
eve cant deploy existing bots to slack
bots do things when a differnt bot is directly tagged

Cortex:
make python interpreter work
x (not seen recently) try for error on submit: Failed to connect to Cortex API. Status code: 422 Response: {"message":"required field 'content' is zero value.","request_id":"f88c2e5a-6747-4a4e-a132-79273c1067ad"}

x make update_files etc not fail if run on cortex bots (check first)
x if cortex api not pupr, default back to complete()
handle > 128k tokens
x make add bot tools to cortex
x work on tweaking prompt for suggesting to run tools vs actually running them
x (not needed-aug pupr for REST API) if going with COMPLETE, make it send the structure of the array properly not just string dumped


processes:
update manage_processes in sql_lite connector and test processes on sql_list creating and running and scheduling
test if update process works
x? make the globals thread id mapped
x fix list processes
(in process) make the task system just a scheduler, use processes for the actual work
make sure that DMs sent from processes can be responded to and bot will know context
x make it start a new run for each process step and/or when it gets close to 10 min
X make get_next_step make sure process is already kicked off to avoid + error Nonetype and int

July:
x Eves stuff test

PERSISTANCY TOPIC:
x 1. have it proactively suggest tasks to do if it doesn't have enough, and recurring ones, and bootstrap ones
RV-4. give it a tool to see what else its been talking about with that person and with other people
TV-Add knowledged of past and parallel conversations, and a tool to get past transcriptips
Have it proactively suggest future tasks
Haves bots reach out to you to see if you need help

BIG THINGS:
x Semantic CoPilot tools, Semantic model creation and maintenance, related demos, add to Elsa flows and to metadata search results
TRV-Memory system: revamp and improve (go beyond simple RAG, back to KB?, post-chat capture, ongoing refinement, local indexing)
More advanced tool generation and testing system, and with Zapier hooks via Zapier API
Data engineering use case: define it and make it really work and be robust, with Iceberg migration as a core real-world-needed example
Reflect/Validation: revamp and rework to allow bots to review/revise/critique their work autonomously before presenting to the user (maybe spawn critique threads)
RV-Allow a bot session to reason over all of its threads (e.g., should be able to ask Eve on Streamlit about what she is doing in one of her Slack threads)
Wrap snow_udf as a sdk to be integrated within python apps like State Street Alpha
Bot health monitoring
Bot cost management, reporting, optimization
Parallel sub-bot runs (take a task, divide it by x dimension, trigger sub-bots in parallel)

MEDIUM THINGS:
error handling on sample data not available, and on any other issues
(try reka-core 128k in april) Model backends: Test & figure out when we can use Cortex-native models (Mistral, Reka, etc)
Azure OpenAI support
(asked) SiS how to get "open in worksheet" button for setup scripts
Prevent bots from deleting themselves
Have Harvester use Mistral for descriptions and embeddings
Make an example of another native app embedding Genesis via UDF calls

SMALL THINGS:
(later) Make the file downloader more indepenent of the Slackbot, right now it assumes files come from Slackbot, but they could come from Email as well, for example
(test) Test Asynch tool calling: for long tunning database queries for example
Make all queries use bind variables to prevent SQL injection
Streamlit: move the bot selector somewhere easier to find after it scrolls off (left nav for example when on the chat tab)
Have the bot authorization redirect provide a pretty webpage confirming the bot has been installed, and telling you how to
Add remove tool tool
allow for a mode without slack API keys where users get a manifest and they create the bots themselves
Add links to docs in setup/config steps (e.g. Setup Slack Connection)
Handle openai citations

NICE TO HAVES:
Use openai and/or database-hosted vector search (snow when fast, bq)
Monetization, billing, etc.
Post tool progress to streamlit/snow_udf adapters (not applicable to slack/email adapters)
x SiS app - Eve walks you through the setup steps including script runs
Files and images and non-text stuff in Streamlit
Harvester: give sample data to table summarizer before it generates its blurb, now only getting columns
Harvester: first put things to crawl into the table but marked as to_crawl, so elsa can talk about its progress, crawl from that
SiS app, see past chats (like chatgpt gui)
Harvester: handle removals of databases, schemas, tables (validate stuff in index still belongs there basically w.r.t. control table)
Add images and files in/out to chat log table
Handle more elegantly when a message comes in on a thread that already has a run running (keep them in a queue to include all at once on the next run?)
Add a deletion protection flag column in the bot_serving table
Streamlit: add a tools page to see tools and code
Add a mechanism for license control based on current_account()... share a table with a filtered secure view with license info for the account
    If nothing shared, then after some period of time, display a warning to contact, then eventually go into limited mode
    Have a trial period where you can use it in trial mode before it goes into limited mode
